Make text dropdown in markdown
```
<details>
<summary>How do I dropdown?</summary>
<br>
This is how you dropdown.
</details>


<details open>
<summary>I automatically open</summary>
<br>
Waaa, you see me. I thought I would be hidden ;p .
</details>
```

use a dropdown for getting articles that have titles that are smaller than expected length that begin with original url

making unique current links
instead of parsing for dates, simply compare list of links to previous day's links, if links already exist, remove from list to get current links

keeping unique links - if links are different every day, what if someone doesn't post for a month? their latest article will appear every other day on the markdown headlines document.
